Integration of a Zoovu Assistant on your page is typically being done with the js-loader, e.g.:

<p className="margin-vert--lg">
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://orca-api.zoovu.com/advisor-fe-web/api/v1/advisors/w80Lthm/js-loader?locale=en-IE"></script> -->

<!-- SOMEWHERE IN BODY SECTION -->

<!-- <div id="zoovu-assistant"></div>
```
</p>

<CustomParagraph style={{ marginBottom: "4rem" }}>
    You can add different kinds of parameters to this endpoint to influence the behavior of the assistant. These parameters are added at the end of the js-loader endpoint, just like locale. Those parameters are split with a &.
e.g.:
https://orca-api.zoovu.com/advisor-fe-web/api/v1/advisors/w80Lthm/js-loader?locale=en-IE&disableSessionPersistence=true
</CustomParagraph>

{/* ## disableSessionPersistence=true
<p className="body-bigger">The session is not being stored.</p>

Implications:
- leadgen will not work
- revisiting or coming back from a PDP page is a fresh start of the assistant.
- speeds up the assistant as we donâ€™t have to serialize/deserialize the whole session, which can be quite big for a large assistant */}

## disableStoringSessionId=true

<CustomParagraph className="body-bigger margin-bottom--md">
the session id is not stored as a cookie, but the session is still send to redis.
</CustomParagraph>

Implications:
- [x] This means we CAN use leadgen, but on revisit or coming back from a PDP page, it is a new session.

<p style={{ marginBottom: "4rem" }}/>
## disableTracking=true
<CustomParagraph style={{ marginBottom: "4rem" }}>
    Tracking will be disabled for this Zoovu Assistant. This is not advisable as you will not have reporting data.
</CustomParagraph>

## disableFirstPaint=true
Disables first paint, even if you have this feature flag enabled.
