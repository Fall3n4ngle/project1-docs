# Main changes applied

- Created landing page in the [src/pages/index.tsx](src/pages/index.tsx) file. The components for it are in the [src/components/HomePage](src/components/HomePage) folder;
- Created documentation pages from the Final mockups page in figma. They are located in [docs/zoe-started](docs/zoe-started), [docs/experience-designer](docs/experience-designer) and [docs/conversation-studio](docs/conversation-studio). The last one contains files named integration1, ..., integration4. This is due to their identical navigation name in Figma and can be easily fixed;
- Created custom css classes for typography, colors and markdown components in the [src/css/custom.css](src/css/custom.css) file;
- Configured default docusaurus theme components in the [src/theme](src/theme) folder;
